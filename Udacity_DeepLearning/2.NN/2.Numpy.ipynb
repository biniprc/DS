    "## 1. Why use it?\n",
    "- Python is convenient, but it can also be slow. However, it does allow you to access libraries that execute faster code written in languages like C. NumPy is one such library: it provides fast alternatives to math operations in Python and is designed to work efficiently with groups of numbers - like matrices.\n",

    "## 2. Import\n",
    "- `import numpy as np`\n",

    "## 3. Data Types & Shapes\n",
    "- `ndarray` : similar to python lists, can have any # of dimensions with fast math operations.\n",
    "    + can represent any dim of data : scalar, vector, matrix, tensor\n"
